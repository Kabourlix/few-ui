# Few UI

This package contains a few widgets elements for UI creation.
They are listed below : 
- Tooltip dialog box in game, following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXFoUGw7eKk&list=PLXD0wONGOSCKcUJHc4-7LIkEgvFvJ-nl1&index=4) ;
- Blur panel.
- Progress bar

## Requirements
For this package to properly function, you must use 
- New Input System
- TMP_Pro

## How To Use

### Progress Bar
Simply use the progress bar prefab, style it as you wish and call the Increment method when needed.

### ToolTip in-game
Add a ToolTip Canvas to your scene via "Assets/UI/Aurore/ToolTip Canvas"
You may need to deal with the image component of the Tooltip GameObject if you are not working with URP.

Now, you can simply add the ToolTipTrigger Component to any of your UI or game object to trigger a
tooltip in game. Some animation settings are available on the tooltip canvas.

### Blur pannel

Coming soon.
