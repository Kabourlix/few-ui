# Few UI

This package contains a few widgets elements for UI creation.
They are listed below : 
- Tooltip dialog box in game, following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXFoUGw7eKk&list=PLXD0wONGOSCKcUJHc4-7LIkEgvFvJ-nl1&index=4) ;
- Blur panel.
- Progress bar

## Requirements
For this package to properly function, you must use 
- New Input System
- TMP_Pro

## How To Use

### Progress Bar
Simply use the progress bar prefab, style it as you wish and call the Increment method when needed.

### ToolTip in-game
Drag the TooltipCanvas into your scene (it must be a separate canvas from your main one). 

Now, you can simply add the ToolTipTrigger Component to any of your UI or game object to trigger a
tooltip in game. Some animation settings are available on the tooltip canvas.

### Blur pannel

Coming soon.
